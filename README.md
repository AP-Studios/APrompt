# APrompt
APrompt is a terminal program for Windows, with easy to remember commands. APrompt is based on Java and therefore the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed on your system. APrompt was tested in: Windows10

# How to install
1. Make sure that the [JRE](https://www.java.com/en/download/) is installed on your Windows device.
2. Click Code/Download Zip in the APrompt repository.
3. Save the file in your download folder.
4. Unzip the ZIP file in a directory where Java has the permission to create / delete / modify files. (For example here: C:\Users\%USERNAME%)
5. Create an environment variable named "APROMPT_HOME" with the value of the directory where you extracted the APrompt files.

That's it! We recommend starting APrompt from the shortcut. If you now click on the shortcut file, APrompt will (hopefully) start. APrompt is currently still in the beta development phase.
